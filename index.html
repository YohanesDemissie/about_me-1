      <p>My name is Jules Duro and I am a student at Code Fellows Seattle. I'm 22
        years old and was born in Renton, Washington, but lived in Mesa, Arizona
        for most of my life. I love gaming, pineapple pizza, and dogs. I went to
        college in Arizona and studied criminal justice, but my most recent experience
        is in retail as a stock coordinator. I have many goals, such as traveling
        the world, starting a business, and one day I hope to work in the video
        game industry.<p>
